# Neural_Network
The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. ... We're focusing on handwriting recognition because it's an excellent prototype problem for learning about neural networks in general

 in this model dataset is used MNIST dataset in this dataset have large amount of 28*28 pixel gray scale label photos. this data set is used to train model when model is completely train then test the model. for testing model some photos of digit is given in repository
